code:
```
SELECT name 
FROM person    
WHERE person.id in (SELECT person_id
					from person_order
					where menu_id in (13,14,18) and order_date = '2022-01-07')
```
output:

#### Exercise 06

task text:
Please use SQL construction from Exercise 05 and add a new calculated column (use column's name ‘check_name’) with a check statement (a pseudo code for this check is presented below) in the `SELECT` clause.

code:
```
SELECT name,
       CASE 
           WHEN name = 'Denis' THEN 'true' 
           ELSE 'false' 
       END 
FROM person    
WHERE id IN (SELECT person_id
              FROM person_order
              WHERE menu_id IN (13, 14, 18) 
              AND order_date = '2022-01-07');
```

### exercise 07

Task text:
Let’s apply data intervals for the `person` table. 
Please make a SQL statement which returns a person's identifiers, person's names and interval of person’s ages (set a name of a new calculated column as ‘interval_info’) based on pseudo code below. 

code:
```
SELECT id,
       name,
       CASE 
           WHEN age >= 10 AND age <= 20 THEN 'interval #1'
           WHEN age > 20 AND age < 24 THEN 'interval #2'
           ELSE 'interval #3'
       END AS interval_info
FROM person
ORDER BY interval_info ASC; 
```

output:

### exercise 08

order by id
```

output:

### exercise 09

Task text:
Please make a select statement that returns person names and pizzeria names based on the `person_visits` table with date of visit in a period from 07th of January to 09th of January 2022 (including all days) (based on internal query in `FROM` clause) .


Please take a look at the pattern of the final query.

    SELECT (...) AS person_name ,  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
            (...) AS pizzeria_name  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
    FROM (SELECT … FROM person_visits WHERE …) AS pv -- this is an internal query in a main FROM clause
    ORDER BY ...

Please add a ordering clause by person name in ascending mode and by pizzeria name in descending mode

code:
```
SELECT (SELECT name FROM person WHERE id = pv.person_id) AS person_name,
       (SELECT name FROM pizzeria WHERE id = pv.pizzeria_id) AS pizzeria_name 
FROM (SELECT person_id, pizzeria_id 
      FROM person_visits 
      WHERE visit_date BETWEEN '2022-01-07' AND '2022-01-09') AS pv
ORDER BY person_name ASC, pizzeria_name DESC;
